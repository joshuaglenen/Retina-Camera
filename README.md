# Introduction

This project explores the design of a low-cost, modular fundus camera for retinal imaging. Using off-the-shelf optics and a machine-vision camera, it demonstrates that high-quality fundus imaging can be achieved at a fraction of the cost of existing commercial systems.

## Purpose

Allows a physician to observe fundus images including the retina, macula, optic disc, and blood vessels. Can be used to observe signs of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, retinal tears, intraocular tumors, etc.

## Design

The design is built around a swapable 20D aspheric lens and a machine-vision camera with a C-mount macro lens, combined with a beam-splitter module for coaxial illumination using NIR and white LEDs. Each stage of the optical path is modeled as a discrete, swappable module in Fusion 360, making it easy to iterate and reconfigure.

## Components

Key components include a FLIR Blackfly S camera, 20D double-aspheric lens, polarizing filters, diffuser, custom beam-splitter housing, LED PCB, and modular eyecup and adapter assemblies. 


## Results

While the prototype has not been fabricated, CAD modeling and optical layout demonstrate feasibility. Comparable systems retail for $5,000â€“$10,000+, suggesting strong potential for a cost-reduced alternative. Future work will focus on building a working prototype, validating optical performance, and exploring clinical viability.
